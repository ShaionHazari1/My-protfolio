            <p>As a non-profit whose mission is to advance equity in education, AdoptAClassroom.org regularly surveys our teachers. One of the questions we ask often is how much do teachers spend on supplies for their students. Understanding classroom needs directly from teachers helps our community support where we can make the largest impact.
        
                Unfortunately, we discovered that during the 2020/2021 school year teachers are spending more out of pocket on classroom supplies than ever before. Teachers spend an average of $750 of their own money each year so their students can succeed.

        <p>In May of 2008, I watched my sister-in-law hold her preemie, baby daughter, McKenzie. God decided He needed her by His side. I remember being in this small room with all of our immediate family, kissing her goodbye. I remember how peaceful McKenzie looked. I remember thinking how beautiful this angel was and could have become. I remember how blessed we were to have her cross our paths. She made us strong.

            McKenzie was born premature at 28 weeks, weighing 1 pound, 4 ounces. For 19 days, she fought incredibly hard, smothered with tubes, and medical personnel, struggling with every breadth. The day before she passed, my sister-in-law called my brother from the NICU, excited to tell him that McKenzie now weighed 2 pounds. Faith is a powerful thing. We were ALL sure she would pull through.
            
            My brother and his wife are high school sweet hearts. They did everything they could to keep their little girl alive. I could not believe God stepped in and took "Mini Mac”. Watching my brother and his wife bury McKenzie the next day is a painful memory that is indelible in my mind.  I hope I will never experience that again.
            
            It took me a while to understand “why". Why I had to watch my niece fight for her life, only to lose. Why I had to watch my brother and sister-in-law carry their child to her grave. Witnessing McKenzie's fight made me realize how special and fragile life is. We only get one, and she opened my eyes. 
             
            So, I made a promise to McKenzie that day. I was not able to save her, and I will do everything I can to save other babies like her.
