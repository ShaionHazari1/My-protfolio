            <p>As a non-profit whose mission is to advance equity in education, AdoptAClassroom.org regularly surveys our teachers. One of the questions we ask often is how much do teachers spend on supplies for their students. Understanding classroom needs directly from teachers helps our community support where we can make the largest impact.
        
                Unfortunately, we discovered that during the 2020/2021 school year teachers are spending more out of pocket on classroom supplies than ever before. Teachers spend an average of $750 of their own money each year so their students can succeed.
